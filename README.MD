# iOS Pentesting Requirements - Intro
An Apple Account and dev profile are required, more details: [Environment Preparation](1_Environment_Preparation/Environment.MD) >> 4.1. Account requirements

A macOS test environment will be required, more details on: [Environment Preparation](1_Environment_Preparation/Environment.MD)

Several tools will be required, or could enhance pentest activities, more details on: [Tools](2_Tools/Tools.MD)

Notes:

-   Typically a Jailbroken device is required to pentest iOS app. If this requirement is not fulfilled u can try:
    -   Patching the App (IPA file), more detail on [IPA Patching with Frida/Objection]()
    -   Use a Simulator or Emulators: [Environment Preparation](1_Environment_Preparation/Environment.MD) >> 3. Simulator and emulators 
-   Ask Dev, team, to compile IPA file with your device UDID. Not really necessary if u use a: [Environment Preparation](1_Environment_Preparation/Environment.MD) >> 4.2. Sideload installation, or resinging the app.
-   For easy activities ask the Dev team for an App (IPA file) with, No SSLPining & No Jailbreak protections. If the app has this protection u can try these evasion techniques:
