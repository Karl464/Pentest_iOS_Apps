# Verifying Jailbeak - SSH

Verify that the device is connected to the macOS environment. try listing connected devices on macOS terminal:

-   xcrun xctrace list devices
-   frida-ls-devices // Requires Frida to be installed

Most of the time SSH service works after jailbreak, if not try installing an SSH tweak. Verify SSH service is working with a local terminal like "Mterminal" and executing "netstat -plnt"

**SSH connection**

-   ssh <default user>@<iPhone IP Address> //Ex. ssh [mobile@192.168.10.11](mailto:mobile@192.168.10.11) , the default user is "mobile" and the password should have been established on jailbreak process, if not try "Alpine".
-   sudo su <Commands> //Ex. use previous mobile password
