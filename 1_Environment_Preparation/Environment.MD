# Environment Preparation

Next will be listed some environment preparation requirements to deal with iOS App Pentesting and Hacking activities. Basic requirements: 
- macOS
- Jailbreak iPhone

Here u will find guidelines to try to fulfill these requirements.

# 1. macOS Environment

If a macOS laptop is not available, is possible to establish an environment with the next options:

-   VM option is portable and easy to reestablish (snapshot on VirtualBox) but It consumes a lot of RAM and performance is poor if a good machine is not provided.
-   If possible macOS Hardware installation on a PC allows it to work better, but hardware requirements need to be checked to comply with the installation process, as not all drivers are going to work (Ex. Sounds or wifi could not work on the laptop, especially on AMD try to use intel).

## 1.1. macOS VM

## 1.2. macOS Hardware installation

**Notes:** sometimes wifi drivers don't work, so try to use a laptop with a physical connection.

# 2. iPhone - Jailbreak

Jailbreak will allow you to get root access to a device.

For that, an exploitation process over the iPhone/iOS is required. Here you will find guidelines to jailbreak some devices (Not all devices/iOS and not all tools) deep information and special guidelines can be found here: [https://ios.cfw.guide/](https://ios.cfw.guide/) and [https://pangu8.com/](https://pangu8.com/)

**Note 1**: Jailbreak can not apply to all devices or iOS, check this link for that: [https://ios.cfw.guide/get-started/select-iphone/](https://ios.cfw.guide/get-started/select-iphone/)

**Note 2**: Sometimes a downgrading of iOS is possible. [https://ipsw.me/](https://ipsw.me/) & [https://www.3u.com/tutorial/articles/7107/how-to-downgrade-ios](https://www.3u.com/tutorial/articles/7107/how-to-downgrade-ios)

## 2.1. Executing Jailbreaks

There are different Jailbreak tools, choice according to iPhone/iOS type/version, not all tools will work on every device (Try hard!)

- [Palera_Windows.MD](1_Executing_Jailbreaks/1_Palera/2_Palera_Windows.MD)
- [Palera_macOS.MD](1_Executing_Jailbreaks/1_Palera/2_Palera_macOS.MD)
- [Palera_Linux.MD](1_Executing_Jailbreaks/1_Palera/2_Palera_Linux.MD)

## 2.2. Verifying Jailbeak

After Jailbreak several elements should arise, like a third-party store should be listed, but the principal requirement should be to establish an SSH connection and have root access to the shell:

- [Verify App Store have bein displayed](2_Verifying_Jailbeak.MD/1_App_Store.MD)
- [Verify SSH conection can be stalish](2_Verifying_Jailbeak.MD/2_SSH.MD)
- Check Jailbroken status with [https://www.3u.com/](https://www.3u.com/)

# 3. Simulator and emulators

If u don't have a iPhone to Jailbreak u can use simulators and emulatros

## 3.1. Simulator

This recreates only the Software behaviors of an iOS device, so hardware elements like touchpad are not going to work

-   [Running your app in Simulator or on a device | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device)
-   [https://fbidb.io/](https://fbidb.io/)
-   [Cross Browser Testing and Mobile App Testing. Test on web browsers, mobile emulators, simulators and physical mobile devices. (testingbot.com)](https://testingbot.com/)
-   [Smartface Mobile App Development Platform for Native iOS and Android Apps - Smartface Enterprise Mobility Platform](https://smartface.io/)
-   [Appetize.io - Run native mobile apps in your browser](https://appetize.io/)

## 3.2. Emulators

This recreates the Software and Hardware behaviors of an iOS device

Note: Some apps use special functions that are only available on HW devices.

# 4. Apps installation

There are multiple ways to install a testing app on an iPhone

-   Deploy directly on Jailbreak iPhone
-   Use a sideload installation utility, that allows you to install apps even on non-jailbreak devices
-   Use Xcode, allows to use Xcode functionalities like debug for testing app

## 4.1. Account requirements

To use next tools, first you require an Apple account and a provisioning profile, fallow next instructions:

-   [How to create a new Apple ID - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316)
-   [Create a development provisioning profile - Manage profiles - Account - Help - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-profiles/create-a-development-provisioning-profile/).
    -   This provisioning profile is required for further Apps (IPA FIle) re-sign or patching activities.

## 4.2. Sideload installation

Sideloading allows you to download and install apps from third-party sources or private IPA files, (even in non-jailbroken) devices.

## 4.3. Xcode

Xcode is a useful tool for testing apps, it requires macOS and installation source: [https://apps.apple.com/es/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12).
