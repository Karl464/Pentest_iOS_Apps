# XCode intro

Xcode is a useful tool for testing apps, it requires macOS and installation source: [https://apps.apple.com/es/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12).

# Provisioning profile

Every time you create a new project in XCode the provisioning profile is established. This provisioning profile is required for further IPA re-sign or patching activities.

Prerequisites

-   macOS Device or VM
-   XCode [https://developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
-   AppID Account - [How to create a new Apple ID - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316)

Activities

-   Create project
-   Extract provisioning profile

## XCode project - Hello World!

1. Create a new "iOS-Objective C" project: [1_Create_App_1.png](1_Create_App_1.png), [2_Create_App_2.png](2_Create_App_2.png).

2. Add some components to the app, to test it. [3_Edit_App_1.png](3_Edit_App_1.png)

3. Check the iOS deployment version. If the iPhone version is lower, the deployment is not going to work. The iPhone version must be greater than the deployment version. [4_Prepare_Deployment.png](4_Prepare_Deployment.png)

4. Check your signing capabilities are in place if not login Xcode with your App ID and follow the instructions. [5_Verify_Singing.png](5_Verify_Singing.png).

5. Run your dev and check if it is being executed on the iPhone. [6_Deploy_App_1.png](6_Deploy_App_1.png), [7_Deploy_App_2.png](7_Deploy_App_2.png).

Note: If the app doesn't deploy due to trust issues check your dev certificate and trust it. to trust your certificate u new to go to "Setting > General > VPN & Device Management > "Your Apple Development Certificate" > Execute trust on your certificate. Instructions for an iPhone 8 + iOS 16.6.

Now u can launch your app

# App deployment (IPA file)

To deploy the IPA file you need to:
-  Sign/Re-sign the App with your provisioning profile (Developer private key).
-  Deploy de App.

```
Note: If You are pentesting a App you should:
-  Re-sign the App. 
or
-  Ask DevTeam to compile IPA file with your device UDID.
No signed App will crash to upload.
```

## Re-sign the App (IPA file)

Resign the IPA:

Check the digital certificate is trusted on your device, [14_Verify_Certificate.png](14_Verify_Certificate.png).
